## üí° How to Run Locally (If Applicable)

This portfolio is primarily for showcasing. However, if you wish to run a similar setup:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
    *   npm or yarn

2.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahmoudsalman158/interactive-portfolio-v2.git # Replace with your actual repo
    cd interactive-portfolio-v2
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   This project might use environment variables for certain API keys (e.g., for a hypothetical Gemini API integration).
    *   The API key for `@google/genai` **must** be sourced from `process.env.API_KEY`. This variable is assumed to be pre-configured in the execution environment. **The application will not prompt for it, nor should it be hardcoded.**

4.  **Running the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open the portfolio in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port if configured via Vite/CRA).
